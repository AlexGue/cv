# My curriculum vitae

This is the repository for storing and building my online curriculum vitae.
With this aproach I have both HTML and PDF versions automatically generated and consistent.

CV is managed as a web app (HTML + CSS + JS).
* Automatically generates and publishes HTML and PDF version on every push to `master`.

Online deploy URL: [https://cv.alexgd.dev/](https://cv.alexgd.dev/).

Autogenerated PDF file: [https://cv.alexgd.dev/alejandro-guerrero.software-engineer.pdf](https://cv.alexgd.dev/alejandro-guerrero.software-engineer.pdf).

## Motivation

GitHub Pages is probably the best place developer could store it's CV. Giving a potential employer a link to your CV stored on GitHub shows your strong desire for automation and definitely stands you out.

The idea behind **The Curriculum Vitae Template** is to provide anyone a quick solution for creating and managing CV (both HTML and PDF versions) with the help of GitHub.

## Installation

1. Create a new repo out of this template by clicking [this link](https://github.com/sneas/cv-template/generate).
1. Clone the newly created repo.
1. Install project dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Run `npm run deploy` to initialize `gh-pages`. This is a one time action. Further deployments will be initiated by GitHub Actions on every push to `master`.

## Development

1. Start local development server with `npm start`.
2. In another console start the proccess for monitoring file changes and generate an autobuild with `npm run watch`
3. Update contents of `src` folder to fit your needs.
4. Commit and push your changes.
5. GitHub Actions will automatically build the latest version and deploy it to GitHub Pages.
6. Open `https://cv.alexgd.dev/`.

### Update contents

The project uses [HandlebarsJS](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/) as a template engine.

The main HTML template could be found in [src/templates/index.html](src/templates/index.html). Metadata for the template could be found in [src/metadata/metadata.js](src/metadata/metadata.js).
